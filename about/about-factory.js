    "need": "Seeing the world through rose-colored glasses has been associated with having a positivity outlook for centuries. However, for chickens, seeing the world through rose-colored glasses has literally been life saving. Many people are unaware that chickens have a natural cannibalistic instinct, which is intensified at any sight of blood. Farmers would watch in horror, as their chickens would mercilessly peck each other to death. They were desperate to stop these mass murders but the chickens found loopholes in all of the farmers’ attempts!", 

    "solution": "Finally in the early 1900s, Andrew Jackson, Jr. created Chicken Sunglasses to help combat this issue. These rose-colored glasses made it more difficult for chickens to see blood and drastically reduced the amount of chicken cannibalism on farms.",
    
    "discontinuation": "The effectiveness of Chicken Sunglasses was so great that they were regularly used until the early 1970s. Farmers that had thousands of chickens were growing tired of putting the Chicken Sunglasses on thousands of chickens so alternate ways to prevent chicken cannibalism were found, such as providing larger spaces for the chickens so they aren’t cooped up in close quarters."

    "need": "However, over the last ten years, owning chickens has become a hipster trend. This has had dire consequences. After decades of being almost non-existent, the rate of chicken cannibalism began to rise since the hipsters weren’t able to provide the adequate spaces for multiple chickens to safely cohabitate. Hipsters were in a “fowl” mood and at a loss of what to do.",
    
    "solution": "Thankfully, COMPANY-NAME remembered the rose-colored solution from over a century ago: Chicken Sunglasses! Since the founding of COMPANY-NAME in 2010, the lives of thousands of hipster chickens have been spared and we are able to offer sunglasses that are not only functional, but also fashionable!"
